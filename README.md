# Forest-Fire-and-Smoke-Detection-System

Every year, thousands of forest fire across the globe cause disasters beyond measure and description. There are a huge amount of very well studied solutions available for testing or even ready for use to resolve this problem. People are using sensors to detect the fire. But this case is not possible for large acres of forest. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for fire detection, in which modern technologies are used. In particular, we proposed a platform of Artificial Intelligence. The computer vision methods for recognition and detection of smoke and fire, based on the still images or the video input from the cameras. Deep learning method “convolution neural network” can be used for finding the amount of fire. This will enable the video surveillance systems on forest to handle more complex situations in real world. The accuracy is based on the algorithm which we are going to use and the datasets and splitting them into train set and test set.

**Introduction**

## Introduction

Forests are the protectors of earth’s ecological balance. Unfortunately, the forest fire is usually observed when it has already spread over a large area, making its control and stoppage arduous and is impossible at times. The result is devastating loss and irreparable damage to the environment and atmosphere (30% of the atmosphere comes from forest fires), in addition to irreparable damage to the ecology (huge amounts of smoke and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere). The conventional method is to prevent illegal logging. The goal of the system is to identify the possible dangers by continuously recording the noise in the forest, by processing segments of the recorded signals and decide upon the nature of each of these segments[1]. It is important to move adequate fire equipment and qualified operational manpower as fast as possible to the source of the fire. Furthermore, an adequate logistical infrastructure for sufficient supply with extinguishing devices and maintenance is necessary as well as continuous monitoring of fire spread. An integrated approach for forest fire detection and suppression is based on a combination of different detection systems depending on wildfire risks, the size of the area and human presence, consisting of all necessary parts such as early detection, remote sensing techniques, logistics, and training by simulation, and firefighting vehicles. Nowadays, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are critical components of the increasingly common IoT (Internet of Things) systems. Such systems have a large applicability, and the environmental monitoring field can also benefit from their innovation. An intelligent forest environment monitoring solution is based on the Raspberry Pi Model 3, analogical and digital sensors and signals analysis algorithms. Parameters such as temperature, gas concentrations, soil humidity, etc. are monitored with sensors while background sounds are analyzed.[2] Forest fire automation incorporates blocks of the functional circuit and sensor modules that are assembled as a unit thus, functioning to monitor the three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called “dropout” that proved to be very effective.[6] Comparison of various machine learning techniques such as regression, decision trees, neural networks, etc. has been done for prediction of forest fires[8]. A semi-supervised rule-based classification model is rarely used to detect whether its zone is high active, medium active (MA), or low active (LA) cluster in the forest[8]. To avoid uncontrollable wide spreading of forest fires, it is necessary to detect fires in an early state and to prevent the propagation. In order to fight against these disasters, it is necessary to adopt a comprehensive, multifaceted approach that enables continuous situational awareness and instant responsiveness. In this paper, we proposed a new approach for fire detection, in which modern technologies are used. In particular, we proposed a platform of Artificial Intelligence. The computer vision methods for recognition and detection of smoke and fire, based on the still images or the video input from the cameras. Deep learning method “convolution neural network” can be used for finding the amount of fire.
